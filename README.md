# Sales-Data
Using Power BI, the dashboard I created analyzes the growth within a company.
I examined the data that shows the growth of the sales within the present and forecasted year. Next, looks at visuals that are created 
for the products performance and country's market share. Lastly, the growth opportunities are looked from, which quarter peforms the 
highest and when sales performing the best.
